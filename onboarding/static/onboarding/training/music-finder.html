<h1>Intro to Music Finder & Implementation Expectations</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>In this session you will explore how the Internet works and demonstrate how data comes into Mixpanel by creating a three-page MusicFinder project. </p>

<h2>Overview of Implementation Spec</h2>
<p>As a general best practice, we encourage our users to create an implementation spec to translate their business goals into specific events and properties. Specs also make it easy to keep track of how you are going to track each of your events and what properties go along with each event.  As part of your onboarding, you will need to give a presentation to your mentor on a fictional or real app, and how they would use each report effectively to impact their business.  You will create an implementation spec for the business, populate a demo project with dummy data using the Mixpanel Dungeon Master, and subsequently use the demo project as a tool to illustrate the power of Mixpanel to understand and impact the business you’ve chosen.</p>
<p>As part of the onboarding experience, you will be building a Mixpanel implementation spec for a company of your choosing.  Please make a copy of this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/a/mixpanel.com/spreadsheets/d/16j0DteModeeIqhp62wAwoUSEPHAA5Pn5sQ6DVVLANtc/edit?usp=sharing">implementation spec</a> via ‘Edit’ → ‘Make a copy…’, share your copy with your mentor, manager and Arthur, and craft away to your heart's content when building out your company's implementation spec!</p>
<p>By the end of this session, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Execute a high-level review of a business, understand their business objectives, understand the journey a user is intended to take to drive towards those objectives, and translate information about your user’s journey into Mixpanel Event and Properties within an implementation spec</li>
</ul>
<p>It starts and ends with business goals.  Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the key business goals?</li>
    <li>What do they want their users to do to reach those business goals?</li>
    <li>How can they measure whether users are doing those actions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to these questions will help you determine what data to track via Mixpanel, and in turn what to include in your implementation spec. Think about who in the business will be using Mixpanel (business dev, marketing, general data analytics) and what information they need in order to do their job.</p>
<p>Using Music Finder as an example:</p>
<p><strong>What are our key business goals?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a Free music-playing site, and money is made through ads that are shown when users listen to songs. The ultimate business goal here is to get users to play more and more songs.</p>
<p><strong>What do we want our users to do to reach those business goals?</strong></p>
<p>In order to listen to songs, users have to sign up and pick a playlist.</p>
<p><strong>How can we measure whether users are doing those actions?</strong></p>
<p>We know that it’s important whether users sign up, whether they pick playlists, and whether they play songs. So we could have one event for each of those actions.</p>
