<h1>Retention and Addiction 101</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Retention report allows you to cohortize groups of users that perform an action during a given period and track their retention over time. This basically means you are grouping users together based on when they did an event and seeing if they remain engaged with your app in a given way. This is an incredibly powerful tool to understanding user engagement, identify what drives this engagement and iterate in order to improve retention across your user base.</p>
<p>The Retention report is often seen as the most powerful report in Mixpanel. This report provides insight into whether users are coming back to your app, and if so, how often.</p>
