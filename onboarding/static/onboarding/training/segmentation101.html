<h1>Segmentation 101</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Segmentation is the key report that customers use in Mixpanel. This session will help you understand the value of segmentation, why we use it, and how the segmentation report is structured.</p>
<p>Segmentation allows you to view top events on your app and easily breakdown complex events in Mixpanel. You have the ability to drill down by an unlimited number of properties to gather instant insight into these key actions on your app. You can choose any individual event in Mixpanel, compare multiple events and see total events, unique users firing these events and average number of events per user. We also give you multiple options to view this data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Events</li>
    <li>Properties</li>
    <li>Super Properties</li>
    <li>The 5 data types Mixpanel Supports</li>

</ul>

<h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
<p>Here are some additional tasks you could give yourself in the meantime to practice navigating the Segmentation report in the Mixpanel project <a href="https://mixpanel.com/report/811293/segmentation">“E-Commerce Industry Demo”</a>: </p>
<ol>
    <li>What's the difference between the totals, uniques, and average options in the menu on the top-right of the plot? Can you build an example to explain? </li>
    <li>Build a report in Segmentation to see which campaign is associated with the most number of purchases under the item category of ‘Entertainment’ OR ‘Electronics’</li>
    <li>How many purchases were made without ‘Harry Potter DVD’s as part of the final, check-out collection of items?</li>
    <li>What feature is not available when you select  "My Top Events" for your analysis from the event menu (rather than selecting a single event)? Why do you think we support this feature when analyzing a single event, but not when analyzing multiple events?</li>
</ol>
