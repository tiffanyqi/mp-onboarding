<h1>Funnels Deep Dive</h1>

<h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Which events do we “count”?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between filtering events with specific properties when building the funnel, and segmenting/specifying for a property in the ‘Overview Table’ after the Funnel is built?</li>
    <li>Be able to define the following concepts:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Loose ordering</li>
        <li>Conversion window</li>
        <li>Changing properties</li>
        <li>Repeat events</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Adjustable Funnel conversion windows? (Whenever there is something really custom you want to do, or something you want to build within a custom report, chances are the API or one of its many endpoints can get that for you.)</li>
    <li>How do properties work? Which ones do we include - First touch, last touch?</li>
    <li>What is backfilling? </li>
    <li>2-second grace period?</li>
    <li>Loose ordering?</li>
</ul>
