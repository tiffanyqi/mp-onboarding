                <li>MaxMind provides geolocation (city, region, country) from IP address - IPs are purged and never on our servers</li>

<h2>High level overview of client side libs vs, server-side implementations </h2>
<ul>
    <li>What’s the difference?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Client-side: data from client interacting with webpage sent directly to MP</li> 
        <li>Server-side: you need to set up your server to send events to MP</li>   
        <li>Server languages: Python, Ruby, Action Script 3, PHP</li>   
    </ul>
    <li>What are the pros and cons of both?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>From a technical & implementation viewpoint</li>
        <li>Can you have super properties with server-side implementations? How do you send properties that apply to every event?</li>
        <li>Managing distinct_id and super properties in exchange for scalability and precise data</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Common problems that can occur</h2>
<ul>
    <li>IP address - how do we determine geolocation with Maxmind? What happens if we don’t add ip = 0 to our server-side calls?</li>
    <li>Unintended ‘Last Seen’ Updates</li>
    <li>If an event or People update comes in via different distinct_id via your servers, what is the result?</li>
    <li>Broken Funnels</li>
    <li>Orphaned profiles in the context of client & server implementations</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No distinct_ids means no data in funnels…</li>
    <li>HTTP → HTTPS becomes $direct</li>
    <li>Refer can be super secretive and encrypted - Google, Apple don’t show this information</li>
    <li>If the distinct_id originates from the client, mixpanel.get_distinct_id() passes Mixpanel’s distinct_id to the server (probably in the URL) OR, you can alias “will” to 123 and register the alias as a super property. then .get_property(“alias”)</li>
</ul>
