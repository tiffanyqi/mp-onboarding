<p>When you do live tickets, you won't know how to do most of them, and that's ok. Here's the general procedure for when you don't know how to answer something:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check the IKB.</li>
    <li>Search through public-facing documentation.</li>
    <li>Look at past tickets on how someone's solved a similar inquiry.</li>
    <li>Ask within your team.</li>
    <li>Ask in DFTQ!</li>
