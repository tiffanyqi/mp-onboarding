            <div class="week-group 0">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>Your first week will be spent primarily acclimating with the team and familiarising yourself with Mixpanel - the product, the services we provide, the day-to-day functions of the organisation, and of course, the people that make working here so awesome!</p>
                <p>You will also have a variety of projects and milestones that you will be working towards every week. Below are a few to help you get started in becoming a fully ramped-up Support Engineer:</p>
                <h3>Training Sessions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full attention</li>
                    <li>Take notes! Thereâ€™s a lot of ground to cover so youâ€™ll be doing your brain a service if you take notes in each session</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Music Finder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a Music Finder folder</li>
                    <li>Download Sublime</li>
                    <li>Configure Music Finder to run locally</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Implementation Spec</h3>
                Pick a company of interest (anything you want!), and after reading this <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-do-i-create-a-tracking-plan">guide</a>, start considering:
                <ul>
                    <li>What business objectives matter most to that business?</li>
                    <li>What kind of questions should I ask to improve the business's ability to reach those objectives?</li>
                    <li>How can tracking analytics help answer those questions?</li>
                    <li>How can Mixpanel's specific analytics philosophy/design help answer those questions?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Webinar</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch the webinar and take notes!</li>
                    <li>What doesnâ€™t seem clear about the webinar? </li>
                    <li>Whatâ€™s disconnected?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will begin hosting the webinar near week 5+ (or further out - they are held bi-monthly on Tuesdays at 11am. Have questions? Ask Ehsan!)</li>
                        <li>To watch the webinar, register on the intro help page <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/webinar-resource-page">here</a> and make your way to Herbie ~15 minutes before the webinar starts</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>Meet people!</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The more people you meet, the better time youâ€™ll have! Itâ€™s simple. :)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="week-group 1">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>During the second week, you will continue to attend one-on-one trainings with either a focused deep-dive on previously visited topics, or trainings on more advanced topics.  You will also continue to ramp up on tickets by completing a higher number of practice tickets, and continue familiarising your understanding of Mixpanelâ€™s value-add through the Webinar and implementation spec:</p>
                <h3>Music Finder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete objectives 1-4 in Music Finder</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Implementation Spec</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-do-i-create-a-tracking-plan">Build out an implementation spec for the company youâ€™ve chosen</a></li>
                    <li>Include events, triggers, properties, super properties, people properties. </li>
                    <li>Justify how and why each event/property applies to solving a product or business goal.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Meet people!</h3>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="week-group 2">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>One-on-one trainings will continue to take up the majority of your time, however there will be a divide between continued focused deep-dive trainings and exposure to real tickets.  You will also finish off the remainder of practice tickets, attend paired ticketing sessions, and begin answering basic L1 tickets.</p>
                <p>By now you should also be approaching the tail end of your onboarding projects surrounding the implementation of Mixpanel on your Music Finder, and finalizing your implementation spec in preparation of your demo call.</p>
                <h3>Music Finder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete all objectives in Music Finder</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Implementation Spec</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finalize revisions of your implementation spec based off mentor feedback, and begin populating your demo project with Dungeon Master</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Paired Ticketing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will spend 2-3 hours during the week to work through real tickets with a Support Engineer</li>
                    <li>Remember - they are taking time out of their work day to help you learn.  Come prepared to apply all that youâ€™ve been learning through your training sessions and paired ticketing.  Suggest answers and interpretations.  Ask questions and challenge your paired ticketing trainer!</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>L1 Tickets</h3>
                <ul>
                    </li>The team will keep an eye out for certain L1 tickets so that you may begin familiarizing yourself with ticketing workflow and supporting live-customers</li>
                    <li>When in doubt, ASK. Weâ€™re all here to support the same customers and to provide an awesome customer experience.. :)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Meet people!</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The more people you meet, the better time youâ€™ll have! Itâ€™s simple. :)</li>

            </div>
            <div class="week-group 3">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>Paired ticketing and ticketing responsibilities will now take up the majority of your time while you finish out the remaining trainings.  You will also have finished off answering and reviewing the remainder of practice tickets, attend paired ticketing sessions, and continue answering basic L1 tickets.  You should now be wrapping your onboarding projects and ready to give your demo call, host the webinar in the upcoming weeks, shadow calls and begin completing a certain number of new tickets each day.</p>
                <h3>Music Finder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete Music Finder to both you and your manager's satisfaction</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Meet people!</h3>
