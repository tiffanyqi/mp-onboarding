            <h2>How To Use This Guide</h2>
            <p>So glad you were able to find this guide. This guide was built by a new Support Engineer who wanted a better way to onboard (and wanted to also practice her Django and Javascript). This guide's aim is to help keep you on track and stay organized for each day and each week.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="/">Onboarding Guide</a>, on the left you have your personalized training calendar by day, and on the right you have your weekly milestones and objectives to keep you focused. Your calendar shows you your current day. The fast backward button takes you back a week, fast forward takes you forward a week, left arrow takes you back a day, and the right arrow takes you forwards a day. "Start" takes you back to your start date and "Today" takes you back to today. Each training has a start time, a title (and a link to further resources), and the location of the training.</p>
            <p>On the righthand side will show your projects and general guidelines for what to accomplish and where you should be for each given week. We highly encourage you to keep in touch with the milestones so you can be all ramped up!</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that you may not feel ready after 4 weeks of official training! Don't worry, this is normal. Be sure to ask as many questions as you can so that eventually it'll all feel natural :)</p>
            <p>If you want to add anything to this guide for all to see, feel free to make a PR or ask your mentor on how to do so. This should serve as a living and breathing document for all new support engineers to feel comfortable with the material, and as a guide for any questions you may have.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or feedback for this guide, do not hesitate to contact Tiffany!</p>

            <h2>Onboarding Structure and General Expectations</h2>
            <p>Your first 4 weeks will be filled with</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training sessions to learn from</li>
                <li>Onboarding projects to complete (including the implementation of Mixpanel!)</li>
                <li>Milestones to hit</li>
                <li>Tickets to crush</li>
                <li>Check-ins to be had with your mentor (daily for the first 3 weeks)</li>
                <li>A LOT of people to meet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you’re not scheduled for any meetings, trainings, or meet-ups you should spend your free time on</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviewing notes and reading up on resources (feel free to reach out to ask your trainers and mentor questions, or if they’re unavailable, anybody on the team!)</li>
                <li>Tickets.  You will start off with practice tickets, and transition over to real tickets in Week 3 </li>
                <li>Projects due for the week</li>
                <li>Milestones to hit by end of the week </li>
            </ul>
            <p>What are some example projects you will be working on?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building your own Music Finder with Mixpanel on it!</li>
                <li>Becoming well-versed enough in Mixpanel so that you may host our weekly webinar and demo Mixpanel to users!</li>
                <li>Build out an Implementation Spec and populating a demo Mixpanel project with dummy data based off this Implementation Spec</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="group" id="tickets">
            <h2>Practice Ticket Expectations</h2>
            <p>Practice tickets are a great way to start to apply your Mixpanel knowledge to customer use-cases. Beyond just learning the product ins and outs, practice tickets also create a training ground for adapting the written style and quality expected from Mixpanel Support.</p>
            <p>Your expectation is to complete <strong>all</strong> practice tickets over onboarding. Completion comprises of three phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Answering the practice ticket in full - leverage all that you’ve learned and the resources you’ve been given to provide the most comprehensive answer possible.</li>
                <li>Getting each practice ticket reviewed - each ticket will state the person who will review the ticket with you in the subject line.  Please reach out to them to schedule time to review the ticket together</li>
                <li>If need be - re-write the practice ticket post-review until it is satisfactory to the reviewer</li>
            </ol>
